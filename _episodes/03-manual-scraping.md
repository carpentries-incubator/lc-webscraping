# Using the Scraper Chrome extension

Now we are finally ready to do some web scraping. Let's go back to the list of MPPs in
the [Legislative Assembly of Ontario](https://www.ola.org/en/members/current).

We are interested in downloading this list to a spreadsheet, with columns for names and
constituencies. To do so, we will use the Scraper extension in the Chrome browser
(refer to the [Setup](setup/) section for help installing these tools).

## Scrape similar

With the extension installed, we can select the first row of the Current MPPs table
right click and choose "Scrape similar" from the contextual menu:

![Screenshot of the Scraper contextual menu]({{ page.root }}/fig/scraper-ontario-scrape.png)

Alternatively, the "Scrape similar" option can also be accessed from the Scraper extension
icon, however this option might return an error on later versions of Chrome. The contextual menu option
seems to be working better.

Either operation will bring up the Scraper window:

![Screenshot of the Scraper main window]({{ page.root }}/fig/scraper-ontario-auto.png)

We recognize that Scraper has generated XPath queries that corresponds to the data we had
selected upon calling it. The Selector (highlighted in red in the above screenshot)
 has been set to `//tbody/tr[td]` which selects
all the rows of the table, delimiting the data we want to extract.

In fact, we can try out that query using the technique that we learned in the previous
section by typing the following in the browser console:

~~~
$x("//tbody/tr[td]")
~~~
{: .source}

returns something like

~~~
<- Array [672]
~~~
{: .output}

which we can explore in the console to make sure this is the right data.

Scraper also recognized that there were two columns in that table, and has accordingly
created two such columns (highlighted in blue in the screenshot),
each with its own XPath selector, `*[1]` and `*[2]`.

To understand what this means, we have to remember that XPath queries are relative to the
current context node. The context node has been set by the Selector query above, so
those queries are relative to the array of `tr` elements that has been selected.

We can replicate their effect by trying out

~~~
$x("//tbody/tr[td]/*[1]")
~~~
{: .source}

in the console. This should select only the first column of the table. The same goes for the
second column.

But in this case, we don't need to fiddle with the XPath queries too much, as Scraper was able to deduce
them for us, and we can use the export functions to either create a Google Spreadsheet with the
results, or copy them into the clipboard in Tab Separated Values (TSV) format for pasting into
a text document, a spreadsheet or Open Refine.

{: .callout}

There is one bit of data cleanup we might want to do, though. If we paste the data copied from Scraper
into a text document, we see something like this:

~~~
MPP	Riding	Party
Anand, Deepak          	Mississauga—Malton          	Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario
Andrew, Jill          	Toronto—St. Paul's          	New Democratic Party of Ontario
Armstrong, Teresa J.          	London—Fanshawe          	New Democratic Party of Ontario
Arnott, Hon. Ted          	Wellington—Halton Hills          	Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario
~~~
{: .output}

This is because there are a lot of unnecessary white spaces in the HTML that's behind that table, which
are being captured by Scraper. We can however tweak the XPath column selectors to take advantage of the
`normalize-space` XPath function:

~~~
normalize-space(*[1])
normalize-space(*[2])
~~~

![Screenshot of the Scraper window showing the Column selectors]({{ page.root }}/fig/scraper-ontario-normalized.png)

We now need to tell Scraper to scrape the data again by using our new selectors, this is done by clicking
on the "Scrape" button. The preview will not noticeably change, but if we now copy again the results
and paste them in our text editor, we should see

~~~
MPP	Riding	Party
Anand, Deepak	Mississauga—Malton	Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario
Andrew, Jill	Toronto—St. Paul's	New Democratic Party of Ontario
Armstrong, Teresa J.	London—Fanshawe	New Democratic Party of Ontario
Arnott, Hon. Ted	Wellington—Halton Hills	Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario
~~~
{: .output}

which is a bit cleaner.

## Custom XPath queries

Sometimes, however, we do have to do a bit of work to get Scraper to select the data elements
that we are interested in.

Going back to the example of the Canadian Parliament we saw in the introduction,
there is a page on the same website that [lists the mailing addresses](http://www.ourcommons.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/addresses) of all
parliamentarians. We are interested in scraping those addresses.

If we select the addresses for the first MP and try the "Scrape similar" function...

![Screenshot of the Scraper context menu being used on an address block]({{ page.root }}/fig/scraper-canparl-01.png)

Scraper produces this:

![Screenshot of the Scraper window trying to scrape addresses]({{ page.root }}/fig/scraper-canparl-02.png)

which does a nice job separating the address elements, but what if instead we want a table of
the addresses of all MPs? Selecting multiple addresses instead does not help. Remember what we said
about computers not being smart about structuring information? This is a good example. We humans
know what the different blocks of texts on the screen mean, but the computer will need some help from
us to make sense of it.

We need to tell Scraper what exactly to scrape, using XPath.

If we look at the HTML source code of that page, we see that individual MPs are all within `ul`
elements:

~~~
(...)
<ul>
   <li><h3>Aboultaif, Ziad</h3></li>
   <li>
      <span class="addresstype">Hill Office</span>
      <span>Telephone:</span>
      <span>613-992-0946</span>
      <span>Fax:</span>
      <span>613-992-0973</span>
   </li>
   <li>
         <ul>
            <li><span class="addresstype">Constituency Office(s)</span></li>
            <li>
               <span>8119 - 160 Avenue (Main Office)</span>
               <span>Suite 204A</span>
               <span>Edmonton, Alberta</span>
               <span>T5Z 0G3</span>
               <span>Telephone:</span> <span>780-822-1540</span>
               <span>Fax:</span> <span>780-822-1544</span>
               <span class="spacer"></span>
            </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
(...)
~~~
{: .output}

So let's try changing the Selector XPath in Scraper to

~~~
//body/div[1]/div/ul
~~~
{: .source}

and hit "Scrape". We get something that is closer to what we want, with one line per MP, but
the addresses are still all in one block of unstructured text:

![Screenshot of the Scraper window trying to scrape addresses]({{ page.root }}/fig/scraper-canparl-03.png)

Looking closer at the HTML source, we see that name and addresses are separated by `li` elements
within those `ul` elements. So let's add a few columns based on those elements:

~~~
./li[1] -> Name
./li[2] -> Hill Office
./li[3] -> Constituency
~~~
{: .source}

This produces the following result:

![Screenshot of the Scraper window scraping addresses]({{ page.root }}/fig/scraper-canparl-04.png)

The addresses are still one big block of text each, but at least we now have a table for all MPs
and the addresses are separated.
